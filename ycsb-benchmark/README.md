Benchmark
---------------

1. Set up a database to benchmark. To change the core methods such as insert/scan/etc. use XodusClient class.

2. Assemble the benchmark by running command from the ycsb-benchmark directory.
    ```sh
    ./gradlew assemble
    ```
3. Run YCSB load and run commands. 

    ```sh
    bin/ycsb load xodus -P workloads/workloada -s  > load.dat 
    bin/ycsb run xodus -P workloads/workloada -s  > run.dat
    ```

  Running the `ycsb` command without any argument will print the usage. 
   
  See https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/wiki/Running-a-Workload
  for a detailed documentation on how to run a workload.

  See https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/wiki/Core-Properties for 
  the list of available workload properties.
