/**
 * Environment encapsulates one or more {@linkplain Store stores} that contain data.
 * It allows to perform read/modify operations against multiple {@linkplain Store stores} within a single
 * {@linkplain Transaction transaction}. In short, Environment is a transactional key-value storage.
 * <br><br>Instance of {@code Environment} can be created with the help of the {@code Environments} utility class:
 * <pre>
 *     Environment env = Environments.newInstance("/home/me/.myAppData");
 * </pre>
 * Environment will be created if specified database directory doesn't contain database files. It's impossible to share
 * single database directory amongst different {@linkplain Environment} instances. An attempt to do this (from within
 * any process, current or not) will fail.
 * <br><br>To open Environment with custom settings, use {@linkplain EnvironmentConfig} class. E.g., opening environment
 * with disabled garbage collector looks as follows:
 * <pre>
 *     Environment env = Environments.newInstance("/home/me/.myAppData", new EnvironmentConfig().setGcEnabled(false));
 * </pre>
 * After finishing working with the Environment you should {@linkplain #close()} it.
